# AndroidUnitTest
In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest possible testable software component. Usually, it performs a single cohesive function. A unit is small, so it is easier to design, execute, record, and analyze test results for than larger chunks of code are. Defects revealed by a unit test are easy to locate and relatively easy to repair.
